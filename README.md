## About me

Hi! I've been interested in programming since I was 11 years old, at 13 I started learning my first language – PHP, and at the moment I've been doing web development for about 3-4 years.

For me, programming is not just another hobby, like website design or writing, but one of my favorite activities, more precisely web development, with which I would like to connect my future life.
